Note the efficient form of segment tree does not works for tasks
that require the left child to be right side of the array and right child to be the right side.
Because if the tree is not complete then it leads to wrong answer because the left child might not 
represent the left part of the array
One such example when it fails is CSES Subarray sum queries.
Workaround:
Convert the tree into a complete tree by adding zeros or what is req at the end.
